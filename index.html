			Us living as we do upside down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher
Spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
<br></br>
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
Fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
<br></br>
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across her often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
<br></br>
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
<br></br>
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded
The bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
<br></br>
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you
<br></br>
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

<br></br>

<p>Who will survive in America?</p>
